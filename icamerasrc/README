User Guide
        1. Setup environment
        2. Configure icamerasrc
        3. Build icamerasrc with Makefile
        4. Build and install icamerasrc RPM
        5. Run Gstreamer pipeline with icamerasrc

Important Notes:
    1. The icamerasrc can't be compiled without some dependancy packages
    2. Please get the dependacy packages from your correct contacts.
        See "Prerequisite packages:" for more information.
    3. Match the "RPM" with the source code in this repo.
        For example, this is the commit message.
            Update for 17WW23 release
            Release for 17WW23: icamerasrc-1.0.0-912.9fb2898.x86_64.rpm
        It means the code of this commit match the RPM release of "9fb2898".
        So if your RPM is "9fb2898", you can use this commit code to build.

Setup environment
=============

    System requirements:
        Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04
        glib-2.0
        gobject-2.0
        gstreamer-1.0(Version 1.7.9 is preferred)
        autoconf
        libtool

    Prerequisite packages:
        aiqb
        libiaaiq
        libiacss
        libcamhal

    Install prerequisite prerequisite packages:
        sudo rpm -ivh *.rpm --nodeps

    Source toolchain:
        source <abs path of your toolchain script>

Configure icamerasrc
=============

        autoreconf --install

    Strongly recommend to assign location to 'LIBCAMHAL_INSTALL_DIR' and 'ICAMERASRC_INSTALL_DIR',
    otherwise icamerasrc will find header files and libs of libcamhal in default location:
        "/usr/include" and  "/usr/lib"
    which might be unsafe locations for certain toolchain that cause configure failure.
    (e.g. export LIBCAMHAL_INSTALL_DIR=<abs_path>/libcamhal,
     the subdirectory of $LIBCAMHAL_INSTALL_DIR should be including:
      1.include/
      2.include/api
      3.include/utils
      4.include/lib)

    then start configuring:
        CPPFLAGS="-I$LIBCAMHAL_INSTALL_DIR/include/ -I$LIBCAMHAL_INSTALL_DIR/include/api -I$LIBCAMHAL_INSTALL_DIR/include/utils " LDFLAGS="-L$LIBCAMHAL_INSTALL_DIR/lib/" CFLAGS="-O2" CXXFLAGS="-O2" ./configure ${CONFIGURE_FLAGS} --prefix=$ICAMERASRC_INSTALL_DIR DEFAULT_CAMERA=0

Build icamerasrc with Makefile
=============

        make clean

        make -j

        sudo make install

Build and install icamerasrc RPM
=============

    This step is taken after building successed

    Build RPM:
        make rpm (RPM package is generated in rpm/)

    Install RPM:
        rpm -ivh icamerasrc-*.rpm

Run Gstreamer pipeline with icamerasrc
